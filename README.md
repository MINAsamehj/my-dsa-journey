# my-dsa-journey
 My personal journey through LeetCode and DSA, solving problems by algorithmic patterns and documenting what I learn.ðŸ’¯


This is 7 days leetcode challenge , when everyday i will solve 15 problems of a specific algorithm 
## Day ZERO
1-not much
2-Creating the repo, make a plan, prepare all possible algorithsms to solve problems from all algorithms
3-prepare medium to write an article for rhis challenge
### make rules 
RULE NUMBER 1 : no AI is allowed to solve problems
RULE NUMBER 2 : all levels must be solved in each algorithm [easy , medium , hard]

what is coming ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
